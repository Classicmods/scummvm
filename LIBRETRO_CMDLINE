LIBRETRO COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can pass the ScummVM command line parameters to the libretro core by
creating a text file containing the commands and then using that file as
a rom file for the core.

Example for Day of the Tentacle:
1. Add "Day of the Tentacle" to ScummVM using the built-in ScummVM GUI.
2. Make note of the gameid (in this case "tentacle")
3. Create a text file containing the game id

For example:
"Day of the Tentacle.scummvm" --> inside the file is written a single line with
the word "tentacle"

Launch retroarch with the scummvm core and with this text file as the rom:
./retroarch -L scummvm_libretro.so "/myroms/Day of the Tentacle.scummvm"

The game will now launch directly instead of showing the ScummVM GUI.
You can pass other ScummVM parameters in the text file besides the gameid.
